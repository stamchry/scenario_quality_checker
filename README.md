Analyze ASAM OpenSCENARIO `.xosc` files for structural, schema, and motion issues, then generate PDF and CSV reports for single files or batches. The tool is designed for scenario authors and reviewers who need a quick, repeatable way to validate scenarios and spot common mistakes before simulation.

## What it does
At a high level, the checker:
- Tries to load the file as XML and validates it against the matching OpenSCENARIO 1.x schema.
- Parses the scenario into a structured model to access entities, storyboard content, and trajectories.
- Runs a set of consistency and dynamics checks.
- Produces a human-readable PDF summary and/or a machine-readable CSV with the findings.

## What it checks
- XML loadability and OpenSCENARIO schema validation (OpenSCENARIO 1.x)
- Scenario parsing with `scenariogeneration`
- Entity bookkeeping: missing definitions, duplicate or intersecting init positions, add/remove consistency
- Motion quality: acceleration and swim angle warnings/errors

## How it works (short walkthrough)
1. XML + XSD validation
   - The file is parsed as XML.
   - The OpenSCENARIO version is read from the header (`revMajor`/`revMinor`).
   - The matching `OpenSCENARIO_<version>.xsd` file is used to validate the XML.
2. Scenario parsing
   - The scenario is parsed using `scenariogeneration` to access entities, init actions, and trajectories.
   - Parameter declarations outside the storyboard are expanded so the parser sees concrete values.
3. Consistency checks
   - Entities referenced by the storyboard must be defined.
   - Initial positions are compared to detect duplicates or geometric overlaps.
   - Add/remove events are checked against initial and parked entities.
4. Dynamics checks
   - For trajectory events, speed, acceleration, and swim angle are derived from positions over time.
   - Entities crossing threshold values are reported as warnings or errors.
   - If available, a simulation can be conducted to assess more than TrajectoryActions. Therefore, esmini hat to be used.

## Outputs
- Per-scenario report: PDF summary and/or CSV detail
- Aggregated report: rollup table across a folder of `.xosc` files

## Installation
Install Python 3.9+ (Conda recommended) and the dependencies.

```bash
conda create -n sqc python=3.9
conda activate sqc
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick start
Single file with PDF and CSV:

```bash
python -m quality_checker quality_check_single \
  --file-path example_files/envelope_dynamic_error_1.xosc \
  --out-path reports/ \
  --schema-path schemas/ \
  --out-pdf \
  --out-csv
```

Multiple files with per-file and aggregated outputs:

```bash
python -m quality_checker quality_check_multiple \
  --files-path example_files/ \
  --out-path reports/ \
  --schema-path schemas/ \
  --single \
  --aggregated \
  --out-pdf \
  --out-csv
```

## Command reference
The CLI is implemented with Typer and is invoked via `python -m quality_checker`.

### `quality_check_single`
Checks one `.xosc` file and optionally creates reports.

Options:
- `--file-path`: input `.xosc` file (required)
- `--out-path`: output directory for reports (default `reports/single_reports/`)
- `--schema-path`: directory containing `OpenSCENARIO_*.xsd` (default `schemas/`)
- `--out-pdf`: create a PDF report
- `--out-csv`: create a CSV report
- `--print-log`: enable log output
- `--esmini-path`: optional path to an `esmini` executable. If provided,
  the checker runs a short, headless simulation of the scenario and uses
  the resulting trajectories for the dynamic checks and trajectory plots
  instead of only relying on the static trajectory definitions from the
  `.xosc` file.

### `quality_check_multiple`
Checks all `.xosc` files in a directory. Optionally creates per-file and aggregated reports.

Options:
- `--files-path`: directory with `.xosc` files (required)
- `--out-path`: output directory for reports (default `reports/`)
- `--schema-path`: directory containing `OpenSCENARIO_*.xsd` (default `schemas/`)
- `--single`: create per-file reports under `reports/single_reports/`
- `--aggregated`: create a combined report across all files
- `--out-pdf`: create PDF report(s)
- `--out-csv`: create CSV report(s)
- `--print-log`: enable log output
- `--esmini-path`: optional path to an `esmini` executable. If provided,
  each scenario is also simulated headless and the resulting trajectories
  are used for dynamic checks and trajectory plots.

## Output locations
Make sure `--out-path` exists when running `quality_check_single`.

- Single file:
  - PDF: `{out-path}/<scenario-stem>.pdf`
  - CSV: `{out-path}/<scenario-file>.csv` (note: includes the `.xosc` extension)
- Multiple files (aggregated):
  - PDF: `{out-path}/aggregate_report.pdf`
  - CSV: `{out-path}/aggregate_data.csv`
- Multiple files (single reports):
  - `{out-path}/single_reports/` (PDF/CSV per file)
